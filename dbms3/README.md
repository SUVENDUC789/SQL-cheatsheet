# DBMS CLASS 3

### 1) SHOW MAXIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
```SQL

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP);

```

### 2) SHOW MINIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:
```SQL

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP);

```

### 3) SHOW SECOND MAXIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:

```SQL

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP ;

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY<(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP); 

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY<(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP));

```

### 4) SHOW THIRD MAXIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:

```SQL

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP;

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY <(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP);

SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY <(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP));

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY <(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP)));

```

### 5) SHOW SECOND MINIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:

```SQL

SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP;

SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP);

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP));

```

### 6) SHOW THIRD MINIMUM SALARY WITH EMPLOYEE DETAILS:

```SQL

SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP;

SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP);

SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP));

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>(SELECT MIN(SALARY) FROM EMP)));

```

### 7) FIND OLDEST EMPLOYEE:

```SQL

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE (TRUNC((SYSDATE-DOB)/365))=(SELECT MAX(TRUNC((SYSDATE-DOB)/365)) AS "MAX-AGE" FROM EMP);

```

### 8) FIND YOUNGEST EMPLOYEE:

```SQL

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE (TRUNC((SYSDATE-DOB)/365))=(SELECT MIN(TRUNC((SYSDATE-DOB)/365)) AS "MAX-AGE" FROM EMP);

```
### 9) SHOW ALL AGE EMP:

```SQL

SELECT ID,NAME,SALARY,CITY,DOB,(TRUNC((SYSDATE-DOB)/365)) AS "AGE" FROM EMP;

```
### 10) FIND MAX SALARY WITH OUT USING AGRIGATE FUNCTION USING ALL() AND DISTINCT():

```SQL

SELECT DISTINCT(SALARY) FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>=ALL(SELECT SALARY FROM EMP);

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT SALARY FROM EMP WHERE SALARY>=ALL(SELECT SALARY FROM EMP));

```
### 11) FIND MAX SALARY WITH OUT USING AGRIGATE FUNCTION:

```SQL

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SALARY=(SELECT SALARY FROM EMP WHERE SALARY<=ALL(SELECT SALARY FROM EMP));

```
### 12) USING CONSTRAINS:

```SQL

CREATE TABLE EMP(
	ID VARCHAR2(5) CHECK(ID LIKE 'S%'),
	NAME VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,
	SALARY NUMBER(5) CHECK(SALARY>=5000),
	CITY VARCHAR2(15) CHECK(CITY IN('KOLKATA','PUNE','LONDON')),
	DOB DATE,
	PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

INSERT INTO EMP VALUES('S-01','MITHU','5000','KOLKATA','17-OCT-1981');
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES('S-02','RAHUL','18000','PUNE','19-OCT-2002');

```
